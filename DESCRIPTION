Description: This package reimplements circular-linear regression and other 
    selected functionality from the 'circular' package for improved performance 
    (particularly by avoiding construction of large diagonal matrices), with 
    additional functions for time-of-day variables in "HH:MM" format. 'WH' code
    is designed to maximise speed, for use in simulation studies. As such, input
    validation is minimal and the user is responsible for ensuring valid use.
